</p>

## Local installation

- Step 1 : Install and run Docker [Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

- Step 2 : Clone the project and replace the ".env-example" file extensions with ".env", as well as the "msmtprc-example" with "msmtprc". Variables are already filled, but it's recommended to replace them with your own values.

- Step 3 : On a terminal, go to the project folder and execute :
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

After building, your app will be running on localhost:8080, and Phpmyadmin on localhost:8081.
